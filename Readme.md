## Tasks and Achievements


### 1. Dataset Exploration and Visualization
- Explored the Boston Housing dataset to understand its structure and features.
- Utilized Seaborn's `pairplot()` to visualize relationships between features and the target variable (PRICE).

### 2. Data Preparation and Model Development
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets using `train_test_split()` from sklearn.
- Developed a multivariable regression model using features like:
  - Number of rooms (RM)
  - Distance to employment centers (DIS)
  - Socio-economic status (LSTAT)
  - School quality metrics (e.g., PTRATIO)

### 3. Model Evaluation and Interpretation
- Evaluated the regression model using R-squared values for both training and testing datasets.
- Analyzed the coefficients of the regression model to interpret the impact of each feature on home prices.
- Investigated residuals to identify patterns and assess the model's performance.

### 4. Model Improvement and Optimization
- Implemented data transformations, such as log transformations, to improve model accuracy and meet regression assumptions.
- Iteratively refined the model based on insights gained from residual analysis and coefficient interpretation.

### 5. Prediction and Deployment
- Specified input values for various features to predict home prices for hypothetical scenarios.
- Utilized the trained model to make predictions on new data points, demonstrating its practical applicability.
